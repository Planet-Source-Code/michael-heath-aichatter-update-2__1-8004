### Description

Michael has a few changes. Just read the Readme.txt file that comes with him. The code is kinda large and I apologize if anyone has any problems following it. I tried to keep comments on almost everything. Anyway, check this out and please rate it. I know this isn't true AI, it is mostly string searching, but hey, it's still kind of interesting. See what Michael will say to your questions or comments. :)
